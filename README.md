# Vehicles-detection-and-tracking
This program uses a pre-trained model to detect vehicles on the road and mark their track

# How to give it the input

The main folder is objectdetection.py inside it you can put the path of the video in line 73

After that run the file

I followed the tasks, but I had some issues on how to implement the tracking, so I made a solution that works but not as efficient as in the video
